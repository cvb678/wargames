The flag06 account credentials came from a legacy unix system.

This description doesn't really say much, but first thing that came to my head was checking /etc/passwd file, since passwords to accounts were stored there in older systems.
> cat /etc/passwd
We can see a lot of accounts with x as their passwords, but if we try grepping for specific account:
> cat /etc/passwd | grep flag06 
flag06:ueqwOCnSGdsuM:...

So this is our password, but encrypted. Since it's from a legacy system, it's probably encrypted with legacy algorithm, like DES.
We can crack this password using for example John the Ripper.
The password is: hello

Now we can log into machine:
> login: flag06
> password: hello
> getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account.
