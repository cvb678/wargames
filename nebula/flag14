This program resides in /home/flag14/flag14. It encrypts input and writes it to standard output. An encrypted token file is also in that home directory, decrypt it :)

In /home/flag14 there are two files:
 - flag14 executable
 - token with encrypted token

First, let's find out how does flag14 file work. Couple of inputs and outputs:
in:  abcdefgh
out: acegikmo

in:  123456789
out: 13579;=?A

At first glance it seems that it's a pretty simple encryption. For each character in input program takes it ASCII code and adds number starting from 0, incremented by one each character.
To decrypt we just have to substract corresponding values from token.

Encrypted: 857:g67?5ABBo:BtDA?tIvLDKL{MQPSRQWW.

To not do it manually, let's create a short python script.

enc = "857:g67?5ABBo:BtDA?tIvLDKL{MQPSRQWW."
count = 0
dec = ""

for c in enc:
  dec += chr(ord(c)-count)
  count+=1

print dec

Printed dec value is: 8457c118-887c-4e40-a5a6-33a25353165

Now log in on vm:
> login: flag14
> password: 8457c118-887c-4e40-a5a6-33a25353165
> getflag
